HTML5 and XML are both markup languages, but they serve different purposes and follow different rules. HTML5 is primarily used to display content on the web. It includes a wide range of predefined tags like `<div>`, `<header>`, and `<section>`, and it supports multimedia elements such as `<video>` and `<audio>`. HTML5 is lenient with syntax, allowing things like unclosed tags and case-insensitive tag names, making it user-friendly and forgiving for web developers. It’s designed to be rendered directly by web browsers to create visually rich web pages. 

On the other hand, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is used for storing and transporting data. Unlike HTML5, XML does not have predefined tags—you create your own based on the structure of the data you’re working with. It is very strict about syntax, requiring that all tags be properly opened, closed, and case-sensitive. XML is not meant for visual presentation and cannot be rendered by browsers without special tools or parsers. In short, HTML5 focuses on the presentation of information, while XML is all about the structure and exchange of data.

HTML5 introduced several built-in APIs that allow web pages to do much more than just display static content. These APIs work with JavaScript to enable dynamic and interactive features.
e.g Media APIs, Web sorage APIs,File APIs,ets.
